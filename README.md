# What this is

- Opinionated, fast and convention over configuration
- Static site generator for React with Markdown contents
- Uses SCSS modules for styling

# What this is not

- A feature-comparable replacement for Gatsby

# Open issues

- HTML from lazily loaded components (using `import.meta.glob` and `@loadable/components`) are not included in static sites
- Try preact
- Allow to override layout via frontmatter (via 11ty)
